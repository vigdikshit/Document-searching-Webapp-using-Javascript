# Document-searching-Webapp-using-Javascript
A Document Searching Web App where one can upload new documents and search for existing documents using keyword search. Technologies used were Node.js, Express.js, React.js, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, REST web services, JSON . 

In prj1-sol, used Nodejs to develop command line program to add new documents and search for list of documents which contain a given word. Used memory to store data.

In prj2-sol, did the same thing but used mongoDB database to store data instead of memory.

Then in prj3-sol, buiil 4 rest web services to take data from mongodb and represent them in json format.

and Finally in prj5-sol, used react.js to make a one page app where one can upload new documents and search for existing documents using keyword search. Basically, it calls the specific web services which further calls the functions to retrieve or put data into database.
